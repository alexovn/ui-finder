# UI Finder: The One-Stop Solution for Finding UI Libraries
UI Finder is an app that helps you find the right UI libraries in seconds. No more hours of web surfing in search of libraries that match your framework, are popular enough, and actively maintained. You can filter libraries by different settings, sort and order them as you like. Enjoy and have fun!

## Features
UI Finder is a feature-rich app designed to help developers be more productive and save hours searching for the right libraries. Here are some of its main features:

- Filter libraries by categories, frameworks, components, and more.
- Search libraries using the built-in search (currently in Beta, so it may not be very accurate).
- Sort and order libraries by creation date, GitHub stars, or npm downloads.
- Share filtered results with your team and friends using a powerful URL string.
- Switch between light and dark theme modes.
- Mobile-friendly: The app is fully responsive, allowing you to search for libraries directly on your mobile device or tablet.

## What It's Made Of
UI Finder is built using several technologies that make it awesome:

- [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) – A core Vue.js framework powered by Nitro and H3, bringing this app to life.
- [Nuxt UI](https://ui.nuxt.com/) – A UI library that enabled rapid development and enhanced the app with built-in components.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) – A utility-first CSS framework that significantly speeds up the development process.
- [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) – A Vue.js store that helps avoid prop-drilling issues.
- [Zod](https://zod.dev/) – A TypeScript-first schema validation library with static type inference, used for validating server data.
- [Iconify](https://iconify.design/) - An open-source library with thousands of icons and some of them are used in the app.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) – An open-source relational database that structures and stores library data efficiently.
- [Prisma ORM](https://www.prisma.io/) – An ORM that helps manage the PostgreSQL database directly from the app.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) – A strongly typed programming language that prevents common JavaScript pitfalls and enhances maintainability.

You can find additional tools used in this app in the package.json file located at the root of the project.

### How to Contribute
This section will be updated soon.

## FAQ
### Why is UI Library X not listed?
There are many UI libraries available on the web, making it difficult to add all of them at once.

You're welcome to open a discussion about a library you like. If it meets the criteria, it will be added.

### Why is Framework X not listed in the filters?
The goal is to support the most popular frameworks that are widely adopted and competitive.

You're welcome to open a discussion about a framework you like. If it meets the criteria, it will be added.

### Why are there no button, input, or other basic components in the filters?
Good question! Basic components like buttons, inputs, and labels can often be created easily without the help of a UI library. Many of the listed libraries already include these components, so you can search for them yourself without needing a separate filter.

Component filters will be updated over time. Keep an eye out for changes. You're welcome to open a discussion about a component you'd like to see included. If it makes sense, it will be added.

### I want more filtering options!
Filtering features will be added over time, so keep an eye out for updates. You're welcome to open a discussion about a feature you would like to see. If it makes sense, it will be added.

## What's Next
There are plans to add enhancements and new features. Here are some of them:

- Update the library search. Currently, it's in the Beta stage and may not be very accurate.
- Add "Show Previous" and "Show More" buttons to the library list instead of (or alongside) pagination.
- Add more filters.
- Add more libraries.
- Add something special — so keep an eye out for updates!
