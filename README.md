## FAQ
### Why is UI Library X not listed?
There are many UI libraries available on the web, making it difficult to add all of them at once.

You're welcome to open a discussion about a library you like. If it meets the criteria, it will be added.

### Why is Framework X not listed in the filters?
The goal is to support the most popular frameworks that are widely adopted and competitive.

You're welcome to open a discussion about a framework you like. If it meets the criteria, it will be added.

### Why are there no button, input, or other basic components in the filters?
Good question! Basic components like buttons, inputs, and labels can often be created easily without the help of a UI library. Many of the listed libraries already include these components, so you can search for them yourself without needing a separate filter.

Component filters will be updated over time. Keep an eye out for changes. You're welcome to open a discussion about a component you'd like to see included. If it makes sense, it will be added.

### I want more filtering options!
Filtering features will be added over time, so keep an eye out for updates. You're welcome to open a discussion about a feature you would like to see. If it makes sense, it will be added.
